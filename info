This is my work for lab 2 for CSCB07 Summer 2023.

The class Polynomial contains the data of the polynomial using an array of doubles (that contains non-zero coefficients), and an array of integers (containing non-negative powers of x).
Built-in functions for this class include constructors, add() to add two polynomials, evaluate() to evaluate the polynomial for a given value of x, multiply() to multiply 2 polynomials, saveToFile() to save the polynomial in human-readable form in a text file.
For lab 2, the functions from lab 1 have been modified to support the new way in which the polynomial is stored.
